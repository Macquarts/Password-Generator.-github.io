# Password-Generator


##  Project Requirements: 

This assignment requires us to generate a random secure password application for employees, based on the criteria that they've selected.  The application runs in the browser and features updated HTML and CSS-powered JavaScript code. It uses a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. The password includes special characters, lowercase, uppercase, and numbers.

#### Functionality of the Password Generator:

-  A password is randomly generated when the user is prompted to choose from a series of password criteria.
- When the user-clicks the “generate password” button, a series of prompts for the password criteria are presented, starting with the password length range between   8-128. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number. 
- Then the user is prompted to define if they need to use character types, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and or special characters. 
- Each prompt is selected, (by clicking ok or cancel) , a password is generated, that matches the selected criteria.
- If the user does not select any criteria, the program will loop back through the prompts till a choice has been made. 
- All criteria’s can be clicked or just a few conditions can be met. For e.g. Only numbers of Uppercase can be used, or all criteria’s can be selected.
- When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
